# uberSpark: Composable Verification of Commodity System Software


## Introduction
uberSpark is an innovative system architecture and programming principle 
for compositional verification of security properties of 
commodity (extensible) system software written in C and Assembly.

uberSpark has been used to build and verify security invariants of 
the uber eXtensible Micro-Hypervisor Framework (<http://uberxmhf.org>)
and several of its extensions, and demonstrating only minor
performance overhead with low verification costs.
